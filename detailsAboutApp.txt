Pet Services:
Hello Doctor!
First of all, as you can see my github repositroy is a bit messed up but I was scared to delete anything 
incase it might ruin the whole application. I did two branches one for the frontend and one for the backend.
The php files are all found under "php work" commit. 
The database is found under the last commit named  "database".
Everything else (frontend) is in the master branch .

I used ionic for my frontend so you need to run ionic serve -l (would display it with ionic lab)
It will display the home page and you can choose either to sign in or sign up 
then if you signed in/up successfully it will take you to a new page that shows you our services.
You can choose whether you want a list of pet sitters or dog walkers. According to your choise, you will be 
seeing a page with a list of names of the currently available employees. You can press on any username and
it will take you to their own detailed profile which is being retrieved from the database.(i only downloaded to images
and used the same two images for the profile pictures as examples) Lastly, there is a bottom navbar where you can 
switch between the home-dog walkers-pet sitters pages.

This is a summarization of my app! I hope you like it! I worked really hard in order to get this done. 
Thank you for your efforts. Nice to meet you.
